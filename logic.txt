if jnode has multiple actions(EXECUTOR|RULE)
    create bNode for each action
    set the next of the action as the pageId of the bNode
    create a decision bNode
    set the jNode as the pageId of the decision NodeDTO
    set all the bNodes as the next nodes of the decision NodeDTO
if jnode has a single action of type == next
    // update the nodeDTO with next page
if jnode has a single action of type == SUBMIT
    create a bNode of type input collector
    set jnode ID as the pageId of the bNode

if this jnodeId is pageID of anyOf the bNode, 
    set the bNode defined here as the nextNodeDTO of the previous bNode
